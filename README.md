Tell me a little bit about yourself
I’m currently a cs major student at sfsu, and I do coding for hobby, especially web development. I use JavaScript the most of my development. And I am also a backend leader in my team for my Software engineer class. When I frist started college I worked in a retail store as a brand ambassador for Samsung, so basically just talk to customer and understand what they really what, and I really enjoy working there because people there were amazing and they taught me how important teamwork is when it comes to doing things together, like working on a project as a team. So combining with I had done in the past and what I am doing now, I really want to work as a web developer and in a team to solve real world problem. and this is why I am excited for this position.

The company: Affine Finance is a company that help both startup and growing company to run a better business. And Affine will match a finance expert to help these companies to grow their business.

The first thing we do is that we need to attract more people to look at our website, so I would say it is necessary to expose our company on social media like facebook or twitter. And this is the most effective way to get more customers,  is just like how people put themselves on linkedin, so that more recruiters can look at their resume, same thing for our company, we have to expose it to the outside world. The second thing to do in order to grow our company is to expand our customer circle, so most important thing to do is do identify our potential customers, and turn them into a real customer, and this is where we have to work hard on the website and give out as much information as possible on the website so that our potential customers can learn more about it. 

How to make our web app successful. 
1.	Identify our users and understand their needs, the main reason that some software were failed in development was because the misunderstanding of user needs, poor design and planning. (why software fails?)
2.	Communication, teamwork, SE process organization(Soft skills)
If we can give what the customers want, they will want to give us money that we can help them and our company will grow. The most important I would say is to understand, is know what do our customers really want? And what can we do to give them what they want? Think as our customers, put ourselves into their shoes and understand their needs.

1.	I was having trouble with implement the PUT and DELETE route. Normally when you implement a route, you just have two specify the route type when you declare the routing function, and then go over to the html form and change the form method. But the html form doesn’t allow PUT or DELETE, so the only way I can specify the route type was to go back my backend code and do something there. After about an hour of struggle, I came across something call method override, and this library helped me to successfully implement both PUT and DELETE route.
